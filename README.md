### Projects Overview

##  Loop Control and Efficiency

# Infinite Loop
Objective: Create a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 and modify it to run infinitely, continually cycling through the numbers.

# Early Termination
Objective: Implement a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10, with the loop terminating early when it reaches the number 5.

# Loop Optimization
Objective: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop. Optimize the calculation for better performance by using a more efficient approach.

## String Manipulation

# Palindrome Detection
Objective: Determine whether a given word is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.

# Substring Extraction
Objective: Extract and return the first three characters from a given string.

# String Concatenation
Objective: Combine two strings into a single string.
